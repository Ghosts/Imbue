# Contributing

Before opening a PR please create an issue with a discussion of what feature you would like to add (or bug to fix). If the feature does not fit with the goals of Imbue it will save us both time to discuss it beforehand.

In addition, the following must always be adhered to for future updates:

* Preserve as much backwards compatability as possible
* Avoid any large additions that unecessarily increase file size in relation to benefit
* Do not leave any build tools / dependencies in the project directory (feel free to use whatever you want locally)
* **No** third party libraries of any kind

The goal of Imbue is to make using JS for the DOM easier by extending current prototypes in an intuitive and useful way. 

If possible, update the index.html (js.org site) - this is not required, but would save me some time. Thank you for your interest in Imbue!
