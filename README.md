Imbue is designed to replace some of the core features of jQuery, and provide a limited set of useful shortcuts and extensions on top of standard DOM elements in JavaScript. For me, the main goal is to phase out jQuery in projects I'm working on in favor of a very slim library that accomplishes the same usage requirements we had, mainly element selection, style management, and event listeners. Vanilla JS is extremely fast & versatile, but oftentimes performing basic DOM manipulations involves multiple methods or using poorly named ones. Some examples are JS's querySelectorAll() vs Imbue's getElements(), or the simplified document.whenReady() call in Imbue that abstracts away document ready listeners.

_NOTE: this is a work in progress at the moment, contibutions appreciated!_
